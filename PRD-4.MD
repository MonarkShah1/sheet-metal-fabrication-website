1. Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for updating the Services page on the custom sheet metal fabrication website. The update will expand the services section to include new offerings: Engineering, Smart Sourcing, Profile Cut & Bend, Welding, and Finishing. Based on research into buyer preferences (summarized below), the page must provide detailed, transparent information that builds trust, highlights capabilities, and addresses key buyer concerns like quality, precision, reliability, and customization—while aligning with the company's brand (core values: Relentless Refinement, Mastery of the Fundamentals, Truth in Execution; uniques: Manufacturing Simplified, Think like an OEM, Unshakeable Reliability). Maintain an honest, professional tone without hype, and keep AI educational/peripheral if mentioned.

This builds on prior updates (e.g., theme consistency, messaging alignment) and ensures the page matches the homepage's Industry 4.0 theme visually. No major functional changes—focus on content expansion and UX improvements for better buyer engagement.

Research Summary on Buyer Preferences (From Web Search Insights):

Buyers seek proof of precision and quality: Details on tolerances (e.g., +0.001"), certifications (ISO, AS9100), quality control processes, defect rates, and reliable delivery.
Capabilities and processes: Clear lists of materials, in-house technologies (e.g., CNC, laser cutting), prototyping, customization, and supply chain efficiency.
Experience and trust: Case studies, testimonials, portfolios, industry expertise, and how suppliers handle complex projects.
Cost and efficiency: Lead times, cost optimization, supplier relationships, and streamlined procurement.
Educational value: Guides on processes without pitching; focus on solving pain points like supplier headaches.
Reliability: On-time delivery, consistent quality, and design/engineering support.
Sources: Insights from sites like Maysteel, Approved Sheet Metal, JC Metalworks, and forums like Reddit/Quora emphasize transparency, local SEO, and avoiding overpromises.
Project Name: SheetMetalOutsourcing.com Services Page Update (placeholder)

Version: 1.3 (Update to existing MVP)

Date: July 17, 2025

Stakeholders: Non-developer owner, AI-assisted development (Claude Code CLI).

2. Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal: Enhance the Services page to showcase expanded offerings in a buyer-focused way, driving trust and conversions by addressing research-identified needs like detailed capabilities and quality proofs.
Key Metrics for Success:
Content Alignment: 100% of sections incorporate brand elements (e.g., core values in descriptions) and buyer priorities (e.g., tolerances, certifications).
Engagement: Add elements like bullet points for quick scans; aim for increased page views/time on page.
Conversion: Include CTAs linking to quote forms, emphasizing "Manufacturing Simplified."
Tone/Brand Fit: Honest, no hype—e.g., "Proven processes for reliable results" vs. exaggerated claims.
Deployment-Ready: Page deployable on first Git push, matching site theme/performance.
3. Target Audience (ICP)
Primary ICP: Decision makers at multinational companies in Ontario frustrated with supplier headaches in sheet metal outsourcing.
Needs and Pain Points (From Research):
Detailed Capabilities: Specifics on processes, materials, tolerances, and how they solve issues like delays/quality inconsistencies.
Trust Builders: Certifications, case studies, testimonials proving "Unshakeable Reliability."
Simplicity/Education: Clear, educational descriptions aligning with "Mastery of the Fundamentals" and "Think like an OEM."
Efficiency: Info on lead times, cost optimization, and customization to reduce headaches.
4. Key Features and Prioritization
Prioritize adding the new services while enhancing existing ones (e.g., from image: Laser Cutting, Welding & Assembly, Strategic Material Sourcing, Prototype Development). Phase for quick implementation:

Phase 1: Services Expansion and Content Update (Immediate Focus)

Add sections for: Engineering (design support, OEM thinking), Smart Sourcing (supply chain efficiency), Profile Cut & Bend (precision forming), Welding (certified processes), Finishing (surface treatments).
Enhance with buyer-focused details: Bullet points on benefits, tolerances, quality controls, and brand ties.
Phase 2: UX and Integration

Ensure theme consistency (colors, layouts from homepage).
Add CTAs, testimonials, and educational links (e.g., to resources on fundamentals).
Phase 3: Optimization

SEO tweaks, performance checks.
5. Design and Content Requirements
Layout: Grid-based like homepage (e.g., cards with icons, titles, descriptions, bullets). Responsive, mobile-first.
New Services Details (Tailored to Research/Brand):
Engineering: Focus on design support, refinements for OEM-like thinking; include tolerances, prototyping.
Smart Sourcing: Emphasize reliable supply chains, cost optimization, supplier relationships.
Profile Cut & Bend: Precision cutting/bending with tight tolerances, proven quality control.
Welding: Certified welders, quality assurance, reliable execution.
Finishing: Surface treatments for durability, consistent results.
Content Guidelines: Concise, honest—infuse core values (e.g., "Relentless Refinement in every bend"). Include buyer priorities like certifications, lead times. Educational tone without claims (e.g., subtle AI mentions as "emerging trends to watch").
Visuals: Match homepage (icons, colors); add images if needed (placeholders OK).
Accessibility/Performance: ARIA labels, lazy loading.
6. Technical Requirements
Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vercel, Git. Update app/services.tsx and components.
Implementation: Reuse/extend components (e.g., ServicesGrid.tsx); add new cards.
SEO: Page metadata with keywords (e.g., "sheet metal services Ontario reliable suppliers").
Deployment: Error-free, Git-ready.
Testing: Visual consistency, Lighthouse audits.
7. Assumptions and Dependencies
Existing pages/theme from prior PRDs.
No new backend—static content.
8. Risks and Mitigations
Risk: Overloading page—Mitigation: Keep concise.
Risk: Misalignment with research/brand—Mitigation: Cross-reference in content.
Risk: Theme inconsistencies—Mitigation: Reuse styles.
9. Timeline and Milestones
Milestone 1: Updated Services page deployed (1 day).
Ongoing: Feedback and refinements.
