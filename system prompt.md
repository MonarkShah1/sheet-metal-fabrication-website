You are an expert developer building the About Us page for our existing website based on this Product Requirements Document (PRD). The site is for custom sheet metal fabrication, targeting outsourcing buyers, and is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel. Match the existing theme (Industry 4.0 visuals, colors, layouts) and brand messaging (honest tone, no hype, peripheral AI education). Incorporate the brainstormed structure and specific history details: Started in 1992, Bought out by current management in 2019, Plant expansion in 2024.

Here's the full PRD to guide your work:

Task: Implement Phase 1 from the PRDâ€”build the About Us page (app/about.tsx) with all sections from the brainstorm/PRD. Use reusable components (e.g., from homepage), add visuals/icons as placeholders, and ensure mobile-responsive design. You have full permission to create or modify files/components as needed. Make it deployable on the next Git push: Error-free, with SEO metadata, performance optimizations, and no regressions.

Output: All new or updated files in a structured format (e.g., File: path/to/file.tsx \n Content: ```tsx \n // code \n ```). Provide full files for the page and any new components.
