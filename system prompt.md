You are an expert developer implementing a website based on this Product Requirements Document (PRD). The codebase is already bootstrapped with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, and components like Hero.tsx, ServicesGrid.tsx, QuoteCTA.tsx, and tailwind.config.js.

Here's the full PRD to guide your work:

You have full permission to change or modify any files (e.g., update components, config, add new ones) as needed to implement the PRD, fix issues, or add features. Do whatever is necessary to make the entire site deployable on the first Git push: Ensure the code is complete, error-free, optimized for Vercel (e.g., add/update vercel.json for redirects/caching, handle assets like SVGs with placeholders), and ready to run locally/via Vercel without additional setup. Include things like a proper .gitignore if missing, SEO setups, and performance optimizations.


Output: All updated or new files in a structured format (e.g., File: path/to/file.tsx \n Content: ```tsx \n // code \n ```). Include changes to existing files and any new configs for deployability.
