You are an expert developer redesigning the Quote Submission page for our existing website based on this Product Requirements Document (PRD). The site is for custom sheet metal fabrication, targeting outsourcing buyers, and is built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel. Make it highly user-friendly with a logical form, creatively incorporating trust-building features like timelines and testimonials to make users feel secure and valued. No estimator—focus on seamless submission leading to discovery calls.

Key instructions:
- Logical Order: Files (STP+PDF), QTY/Lead Time, details (optional), contact.
- Usability: Multi-step wizard, validation, popovers, mobile-first.
- Creativity: Add "Trust Timeline," mini-testimonials, badges for trust.
- Brand/Tone: Honest, value-focused; no hype.

Here's the full PRD to guide your work:

Task: Implement Phase 1 from the PRD—build/update the Quote Submission page (app/quote.tsx) with the form, trust features, and submission handling (placeholder for backend calls). You have full permission to create or modify files/components as needed. Ensure deployable on next Git push: Error-free, with SEO metadata, performance, and no regressions.

Output: All updated or new files in a structured format (e.g., File: path/to/file.tsx \n Content: ```tsx \n // code \n ```). Provide full files for the page and any new components.
