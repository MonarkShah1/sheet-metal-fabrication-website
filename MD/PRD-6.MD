Product Requirements Document (PRD) for User-Friendly Quote Submission Page
1. Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for redesigning the "Quote Submission" page (or "Request a Quote" page) on the custom sheet metal fabrication website. The goal is to create a highly user-friendly, trust-inspiring form that encourages seamless submissions, addressing buyer frustrations with clunky processes and building confidence in the company as a reliable partner. By scrapping the ballpark estimator, we focus on a straightforward submission experience that provides immediate value through transparency, education, and clear next steps—leading to backend discovery calls for all submissions.

Creatively, the page will incorporate trust-building elements like a "Trust Timeline" (showing what happens post-submission), integrated mini-testimonials, and subtle educational popovers for fields, making users feel supported and informed. This aligns with the brand's Core Values (Relentless Refinement, Mastery of the Fundamentals, Truth in Execution), Uniques (Manufacturing Simplified, Think like an OEM, Unshakeable Reliability), and emphasis on value without hype. AI mentions remain peripheral/educational (e.g., in tips as "emerging trends").

Research Summary on Best Practices (From Web Search and Site Browses):

User-Friendly Design: Logical flow starting with file uploads (e.g., STP/PDF), followed by QTY/lead time, details, and contact; use drag-and-drop, real-time validation, multi-step wizards with progress bars for simplicity. (Sources: , , , )
Trust-Building: Include security badges (e.g., SSL), privacy assurances, "What Happens Next" sections, testimonials, certifications (e.g., ISO), and transparent timelines (e.g., "Quote in 1-2 days"). Educational tips (e.g., "Why STP? For precise quoting") build confidence without selling. (Sources: , , , )
Examples: Protolabs uses automated DFM feedback, instant tips, and certifications for trust; Xometry emphasizes quick uploads and reliability assurances. Focus on minimal fields to avoid abandonment, with disclaimers for accuracy. (Sources: , , , )

Mini-Testimonials: Embedded quotes (e.g., "Quick and reliable—ended our supplier headaches." – Client X).
