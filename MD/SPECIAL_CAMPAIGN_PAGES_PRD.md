# Special Campaign Pages PRD
## Targeted Landing Pages for SEO and PPC Campaigns

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Business:** Canadian Metal Fabricators Ltd.  
**Objective:** Create dedicated campaign landing pages to target keyword gaps, drive local SEO traffic, and increase quote conversions by 100% for high-intent searches (e.g., location-specific, industry-specific, and transactional queries).

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Goals
- **SEO Impact:** Rank for gap keywords (e.g., "sheet metal fabrication Ontario", "automotive metal fabrication Ontario") by creating 10-15 targeted pages with unique, localized content.
- **Conversion Focus:** Each page includes optimized quote forms/CTAs for transactional intent (e.g., "get metal fabrication quote Ontario").
- **Campaign Integration:** Pages designed for PPC (e.g., Google Ads) with UTM parameters, A/B testing hooks, and tracking.
- **Scalability:** Use dynamic routing and data files (similar to `lib/locations/location-data.ts`) for easy expansion.
- **Key Metrics:** Track organic traffic (+50%), form submissions (+30%), and bounce rate (<40%) via Google Analytics.

### Scope
- New routes: `/industries/[industry]`, `/services/[service]-[location]` (for localized gaps).
- Reuse existing: Components from `components/locations/` (e.g., LocalFAQ, ServiceAreaMap) and services (e.g., hero patterns).
- Total Pages: Start with 10 (prioritize gaps), expand to 20+ based on keywords.
- Timeline: Phase 1 (setup + 5 pages) in 1-2 weeks; Phase 2 (remaining + testing) in 2-3 weeks.

## 2. Keyword Gap Analysis & Page Mapping

Based on the provided list, group gaps and map to new campaign pages. Focus on "Gap" notations for prioritization.

### 2.1 Categorized Gaps
- **Location-Specific Gaps** (e.g., "sheet metal fabrication Ontario", "steel fabricators Ontario", "metal fabrication Ontario"): Create localized service pages.
- **Industry-Specific Gaps** (e.g., "automotive metal fabrication Ontario", "food industry metal parts", "material handling metal fabrication"): Create industry landing pages with local ties.
- **Material/Service-Specific Gaps** (e.g., "stainless steel fabrication", "sheet metal enclosures Ontario"): Extend services with localized variants.
- **Transactional Gaps** (e.g., "get metal fabrication quote Ontario", "sheet metal fabrication pricing"): Optimize with quote-focused CTAs and forms.
- **Emerging/Long-Tail Gaps** (e.g., "eco-friendly metal fabrication Ontario", "metal prototyping services Ontario"): Create niche campaign pages under industries or blog.

### 2.2 Proposed Pages (Initial 10)
1. `/services/sheet-metal-fabrication-ontario` (Targets: sheet metal fabrication Ontario, precision sheet metal, high quality sheet metal).
2. `/services/steel-fabrication-ontario` (Targets: steel fabricators Ontario, stainless steel fabrication, corten steel fabrication).
3. `/industries/automotive` (Targets: automotive metal fabrication Ontario, custom automotive parts fabrication, automotive sheet metal services).
4. `/industries/food-processing` (Targets: food industry metal parts, food grade metal fabrication, food processing metal equipment).
5. `/industries/material-handling` (Targets: material handling metal fabrication, metal parts for material handling).
6. `/services/custom-metal-work-ontario` (Targets: custom sheet metal parts, metal prototyping services Ontario, small scale metal fabrication).
7. `/quote/ontario-metal-fabrication` (Targets: get metal fabrication quote Ontario, request free metal fab quote, reliable fabrication supplier quote).
8. `/industries/other/sheet-metal-enclosures-ontario` (Targets: sheet metal enclosures Ontario, industrial parts supplier Ontario).
9. `/blog/eco-friendly-metal-fabrication-ontario` (Targets: eco-friendly metal fabrication Ontario; treat as campaign page with quote CTA).
10. `/services/architectural-metal-designs-ontario` (Targets: architectural metal designs Ontario, small industrial metal projects).

*Note:* For location-based, use "ontario" as a slug; expand to cities (e.g., "toronto") by integrating with existing `locations/` data.

## 3. Technical Structure

### 3.1 File Structure Additions
```
app/
  industries/                   # New dynamic route for industry gaps
    [industry]/
      page.tsx                 # Dynamic industry page
    page.tsx                   # Industries overview/hub (optional)
  services/
    [service]-[location]/      # New dynamic route for localized service gaps
      page.tsx
    // Existing: [service]/page.tsx, engineering/, etc.

lib/
  industries/                  # New folder for data/utils
    industry-data.ts          # Industry content (similar to location-data.ts)

```

### 3.2 Page Templates
All pages follow a consistent structure (inspired by `app/locations/[location]/page.tsx` and `app/services/[service]/page.tsx`):
- **Metadata Generation:** Use `generateMetadata` with dynamic SEO (e.g., title: "Sheet Metal Fabrication Ontario | Custom Services").
- **Hero Section:** Customized `<IndustryHero>` or `<LocationHero>` with keyword-optimized H1, subheading, and CTA button.
- **Main Sections (4-6 per page):**
  - Service/Industry Overview (tailored content, 300-500 words).
  - Capabilities/Process (e.g., steps for laser cutting, material options).
  - Local Tie-Ins (e.g., "Serving Ontario's Automotive Sector" with map).
  - Case Studies/Projects (2-3 examples, reuse `<NearbyProjects>`).
  - Why Choose Us (proximity, expertise, certifications).
  - FAQ (5-7 questions, reuse `<LocalFAQ>` or new `<IndustryFAQ>`).
- **Conversion Elements:** Embedded quote form (pre-fill location/industry), CTA buttons (e.g., "Get Ontario Quote").
- **Footer/Structured Data:** Include `<Footer>`, schema via `<StructuredDataScript>` (e.g., LocalBusiness or Service schema).
- **Unique Per Page:** 70% original content; inject variables from data files (e.g., industry-specific keywords, local stats).

### 3.3 Dynamic Data
- Create `industry-data.ts` (array of objects with slug, title, description, keywords, industriesServed, caseStudies).
- Utils: `getIndustryBySlug`, `generateIndustrySEO` (similar to location-utils.ts).
- For localized services: Combine service data with location data (e.g., from `location-data.ts`).

   - Implement dynamic `app/industries/[industry]/page.tsx` (copy pattern from locations/[location]/page.tsx).
   - Add new components (e.g., IndustryHero.tsx â€“ extend LocationHero.tsx).
   - For localized services: Implement `app/services/[service]-[location]/page.tsx` with combined data.

3. **Content & SEO (Day 6-8):**
   - Generate unique content for each page (use AI to draft based on keywords).
   - Add metadata, schema, and CTAs.

4. **Testing & Launch (Day 9-10):**
   - Test dynamic params (e.g., generateStaticParams for slugs).
   - Verify SEO (titles, schema validation).
   - Deploy to Vercel; monitor with Google Search Console.

### Dependencies
- Reuse: Next.js dynamic routes, existing components (e.g., ServiceAreaMap.tsx for local maps).
- New Packages: None (stick to existing like next/navigation).
- Edge Cases: Handle notFound() for invalid slugs; ensure accessibility (WCAG AA).
