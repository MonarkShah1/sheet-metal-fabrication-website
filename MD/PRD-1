Version: 1.0

Date: July 17, 2025

Stakeholders: Non-developer owner, AI-assisted development (Claude Code CLI).

2. Goals and Objectives
Primary Goal: Create a deployable MVP with a cohesive Industry 4.0 theme that engages buyers, educates on outsourcing, and drives quote requests.
Key Metrics for Success:
90+ Lighthouse score for performance, accessibility, and SEO.
Mobile-first design with full responsiveness.
Address ICP pain points: Quick quoting (reduce friction by 50%), educational resources (e.g., blogs on AI in fabrication to build trust).
Deployment-ready on first Git push: Error-free, Vercel-optimized.
Market Positioning: Stand out by filling gaps‚Äîe.g., competitors lack AI-themed visuals or interactive tools; we'll highlight "smart factory" elements like digital twins and IoT tracking.
3. Target Audience (ICP)
Primary ICP: Buyers outsourcing sheet metal fabrication (e.g., engineers in automotive/aerospace, OEMs seeking cost-effective precision parts).
Needs and Pain Points:
Efficiency: Fast quotes with file uploads and AI recommendations.
Education: Insights on overcoming outsourcing risks (e.g., quality control via IoT).
Trust: Certifications, case studies, testimonials.
UX: Intuitive, tech-forward design that feels innovative (Industry 4.0 vibe) without overwhelming.
User Journey: Land on homepage ‚Üí Explore services/education ‚Üí Submit quote ‚Üí Convert to lead.
4. Key Features and PrioritizatioN
Prioritize the Industry 4.0 theme implementation first. Features are phased:

Phase 1: Theme Setup (Immediate Focus)

Implement visual and stylistic elements across the site.
Ensure theme is applied to core pages (e.g., homepage) and components.
Phase 2: Core Functionality (Build After Theme)

Homepage with hero, services grid, quote CTA.
Quote request page with file upload and form validation.
Educational sections (e.g., blog placeholders on "Industry 4.0 in Sheet Metal").
Navigation, footer, and global elements.
Phase 3: Advanced Features

AI-driven personalization (e.g., material recommender).
Integrations (e.g., email for quotes via Supabase).
Analytics and A/B testing hooks.
5. Design and Theme Requirements (Industry 4.0 Focus)
Based on research into manufacturing website designs (e.g., modern templates from ThemeForest, Dribbble inspirations for futuristic interfaces, and smart manufacturing principles like AI/IoT visuals), the theme should evoke the Fourth Industrial Revolution: A blend of industrial reliability and digital innovation.

Color Palette:
Primary: Deep grays (#1F2937 for backgrounds ‚Äì industrial strength).
Accent: Electric blues (#1D4ED8 for tech/AI elements) and oranges (#F97316 for energy/machinery CTAs).
Neutral: Light grays (#F3F4F6 for cards/sections) and whites for readability.
Dark Mode Support: Optional toggle for low-light factory environments.
Typography:
Font Family: Sans-serif like Inter or Roboto for modern, clean readability.
Sizes: Headings 4xl-6xl for impact; body text lg-xl for accessibility.
Visual Elements:
Backgrounds: Subtle overlays like circuit patterns, robot icons, or data flow visuals (e.g., SVGs for IoT networks).
Icons: Emoji or Heroicons for services (e.g., ‚öôÔ∏è for laser cutting, ü§ñ for prototyping).
Imagery: High-res photos of smart factories, sheet metal processes with AI overlays (e.g., digital twins).
Animations: Subtle transitions (e.g., hover shadows, fade-ins) using Framer Motion if needed ‚Äì keep performant.
Layout and UX Principles:
Mobile-First: Use Tailwind breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:).
Grid-Based: Responsive grids for services/capabilities.
Interactivity: Hover effects, focus states for accessibility.
Industry 4.0 Specifics: Incorporate elements like dashboards previews, AI badges, or "Smart Outsourcing" tags to highlight automation in sheet metal (e.g., IoT-monitored welding).
Accessibility Requirements:
ARIA roles/labels.
High contrast ratios (WCAG compliant).
Keyboard navigation.
Performance Requirements:
Lazy loading for images.
Optimized assets (e.g., Next.js Image component).
Aim for <2s load time.
6. Technical Requirements
Stack: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vercel for deployment, Git for version control. Optional: Catalyst UI kit integration.
Structure: Modular components in /components; pages in /app.
SEO: Metadata API for titles/descriptions; sitemap.xml.
Security: Environment variables; input validation for forms.
Deployment: Ready for Git push ‚Äì include vercel.json for configs, .gitignore for node_modules.
Testing: Local dev with npm run dev; Lighthouse audits.
7. Assumptions and Dependencies
Existing codebase bootstrap (e.g., from previous prompts).
Assets (e.g., SVGs) will be placeholders initially.
No backend yet ‚Äì use client-side for MVP; add Supabase later for forms.
8. Risks and Mitigations
Risk: Theme feels too "futuristic" and alienates traditional buyers. Mitigation: Balance with real industrial imagery.
Risk: Performance issues from visuals. Mitigation: Optimize with lazy loading.
Risk: Scope creep. Mitigation: Focus on Phase 1 first.
9. Timeline and Milestones
Milestone 1: Theme implementation and homepage deployable (1-2 days).
Milestone 2: Full MVP with core features (3-5 days).
Ongoing: Iterations based on feedback.
This PRD is living ‚Äì update as needed.
