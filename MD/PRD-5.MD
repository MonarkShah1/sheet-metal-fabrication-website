Product Requirements Document (PRD) for About Us Page Build
1. Overview
This PRD outlines the requirements for building the "About Us" page on the custom sheet metal fabrication website. The page will humanize the company, build trust with outsourcing buyers, and align with brand elements (Core Values: Relentless Refinement, Mastery of the Fundamentals, Truth in Execution; Core Focus: Solve the basics for all of manufacturing in sheet metal fabrication; 10-Year Target: Facilities in every major manufacturing hub totaling 4.2 million sq ft by 2050; Uniques: Manufacturing Simplified, Think like an OEM, Unshakeable Reliability). Content will be honest, professional, and educational—avoiding hype or exaggerated claims. AI mentions remain peripheral and educational only.

Based on brainstorming and research (e.g., emphasizing company history, values, team, capabilities, and testimonials to address buyer needs for trust and reliability), the page will follow a structured flow. Incorporate specific history details: Started in 1992, Bought out by current management in 2019, Plant expansion in 2024.

The page must match the site's Industry 4.0 theme (colors, typography, layouts) for consistency, be mobile-responsive, and optimize for SEO.
